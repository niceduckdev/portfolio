title: My custom tool that makes college easier

Since I switched to Linux I have been looking for ways to be more productive as a student.

I found a post written by Gilles Castel that explained his awesome way of making notes using Latex and Python scripts.

My tool is written in Bash. You can check out the code on [Github](https://github.com/niceduckdev/setup-for-college).

The structure of my `school` directory is as following.

```sh
course -> /home/kaj/school/semester/software-architecture
semester -> /home/kaj/school/semester-1
semester-1
semester-2
```

`course` and `semester` are both symlinks to the current course or semester that I selected using `./school.sh courses` and `./school.sh semesters`.

All of my keybindings are managed by the sxhkd keyboard daemon. I use rofi to show the output of my tool.

```sh
super + s
    rofi -modi 'semesters:school-setup semesters' -show semesters -p '' -theme-str 'prompt \{ enabled: false; \}'
```

```sh
super + c
	rofi -modi 'courses:school-setup courses' -show courses -p '' -theme-str 'prompt \{ enabled: false; \}'
```

I also created keybindings for opening a terminal or file manager in the current course directory.

```sh
super + o
	pcmanfm /home/kaj/school/course
```

```sh
super + p
	alacritty --working-directory /home/kaj/school/course
```
