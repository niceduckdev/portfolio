I stopped using Windows in my first year in college. It felt too limiting and hurt my developer experience.

Since then I have used a lot of different distro's: Arch, Void, NixOS, Mint, Fedora and finally Debian.

I also switched DE or WM a lot. Hyprland, dwm, i3wm, Cinnamon, Gnome and bspwm.

I currently have a minimal setup based on Debian with the [BSPWM](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) window manager and [SXHKD](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd) hotkey daemon.

I created my own status bar using [EWW](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) and use [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) to launch software. I also use the [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) terminal.

I use the [Gruvbox color scheme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) and the [mononoki font](https://madmalik.github.io/mononoki).
