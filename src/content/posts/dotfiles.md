title: My dotfiles and journey in the Linux ecosystem

I stopped using Windows in my first year in college. It felt like it limited my ability to be productive on my own computer.

# The beginning

I started using Arch Linux with a Hyprland rice but I completely broke it by updating my system. This is where my journey of distro-hopping began. Void, NixOS, Mint, Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu.

I could not get the feeling of a tiling window manager out of my head. I started looking for alternatives that were less bleeding edge and more pratical for everyday work.

I simply could not risk breaking my system as a student.

This led to me trying out a bunch of window managers and desktop environments. My favorites are Gnome (still run it on my desktop using Fedora), i3 and bspwm.

# Current setup

My current setup (that I have been using for around a year now) is based on Debian and uses the bspwm window manager.

> You can check out my dotfiles on [Github](https://github.com/niceduckdev/dotfiles).

Here is a list of some of the tools that I use every day.
- zsh (Shell)
- nvim (Editor)
- alacritty (Terminal)
- rofi (Application launcher)
- librewolf (Browser)
- pcmanfm (GUI file manager)

And here are some screenshots of my setup.
