My name is Kaj and I'm a student at KdG in Antwerp (Belgium). I love creating websites, software and other technological stuff.

I started tinkering with computers and games at a young age. I was really into [Stop motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion) and used my Lego and action figures to create my own "movies".

My developer journey started when I downloaded the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com), that was around 2017 or 2018. I didn't understand a thing about programming but I was immediately hooked.

Fast forward to 2021. By then I had created several prototypes and even joined a few [Game Jams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam).

That was when I first learned about web development. I built the first version of my portfolio using vanilla HTML + Bootstrap and hosted it on the `niceduckdev.xyz` domain.

I started experimenting with static sites and eventually learned PHP to use it in my last year of high school.

I started hearing good things about Javascript frameworks so I decided to create a website for my Chiro using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) and [Chakra UI](https://www.chakra-ui.com).

I didn't really understand the use case of [SPAs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) so I created all my websites using the most overkill tool for the job.

After watching a youtube video about [VueJS](https://vuejs.org) I was really interested. I rewrote all of my websites using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

By this time I had some experience using [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) by working with the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com) and planning the architecture of my projects.

In September of 2023 I started studying at KdG in Antwerp.

We started learning about the [Java](https://www.java.com/en) and basic [Object oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).

The first few weeks were quite boring due to the slow start. The requirement to take exams with pen and paper didn't make it any easier.

In the first semester of my second year at KdG I created a blog using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org) and [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io).

In the second semester I got the largest assignment that I had ever worked on.

Now that I am in my third and last year at KdG I got two large assignments to work on during the first period (1/2 of a semester).

One of these explores the concept of microservices using [Java](https://www.java.com/en) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

The other project is an application to manage a smart home that uses [React](https://react.dev/) (and [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io)).

> Right now I am searching for a company where I can do an internship in the last period of this year.
