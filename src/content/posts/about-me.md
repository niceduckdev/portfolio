Hi there! I'm Kaj, a developer and student based in Antwerp, Belgium.

My journey in programming started eight years ago, and it has evolved into a deep interest for building things that live on the internet.

I enjoy the entire process of development, from designing and building intuitive user interfaces for websites and apps to architecting and implementing the robust backend services that make them work.

Right now I am studying "Applied Computer Science" at KdG in Antwerp.

Contact me via [contact@niceduck.dev](mailto:contact@niceduck.dev) and check out my projects on [Github](https://github.com/niceduckdev).
