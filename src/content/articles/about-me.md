Hi there! I'm Kaj, a developer and student based in Antwerp, Belgium.

I am currently studying Applied Computer Science at KdG in Antwerp.

# Journey
My journey in programming started **eight years ago**, and it has evolved into a deep interest for building things that live on the internet.

I enjoy the entire process of development, from designing and building intuitive user interfaces for websites and apps to architecting and implementing the robust backend services that make them work.

Right now I am in my third year of the **"Applied Computer Science"** bachelor at KdG in Antwerp.

# Tools & Equipment
My workflow is built around a core set of development tools. I only run Linux on my machines and servers.

You can read more about my **journey in the linux world** and my current setup in [this post](/posts/dotfiles).
