One of my first big projects in my first year was to create a clone of Uno using [Java](https://www.java.com/en) and [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io) while using the [MVC architecture](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/mvc-architecture-system-design).

I created a system to make it easier to use this architecture without hard coding the dependencies in each Model, View and Controller class.

I also added online multiplayer by using the [Kryonet](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryonet) networking library.
