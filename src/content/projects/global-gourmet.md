This website was developed during my second year at KdG for the Communication 2 course, where I implemented VueJS as the frontend framework with Tailwind CSS for styling and Nunito as the primary typeface.

I used the Pocketbase backend, an open-source SQLite-based database that was straightforward to set up.

The entire project is deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

While VueJS's single-page application router excelled at client-side interactivity, the project's requirements would have been better served by a server-side approach given the limited need for dynamic functionality.
