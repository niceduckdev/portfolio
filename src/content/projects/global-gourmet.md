This website was made in my second year at KdG for the "Communication 2" course. It uses the [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) framework and uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the styling.

[Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) is used as the typeface.

I used an open source database based on SQLite called [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/). It is incredibly easy to set up and use.

The site is deployed on [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

If I had to develop this website right now I would go for a more server side approach. This uses VueJS's SPA router which is great for applications with a lot of client side interactivity. This site doesn't need that amount of complexity.
