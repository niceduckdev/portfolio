The first version of this website was made using NextJS with the ChakraUI.

After learning a lot about client side javascript frameworks I remade it using VueJS and Tailwind, mirroring the style of ChakraUI. Using a client side javascript framework for this type of website was pretty stupid and overkill.

The current version is built using Astro and Tailwind. It is typeset in Nunito and is deployed on Cloudflare Pages.
