The first version of this website was made using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) with the [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com) framework.

After learning a lot about client side javascript frameworks I remade it using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), mirroring the style of [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com.).

Using a client side javascript framework for this type of website was pretty stupid and overkill. That's why I remade the site using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

[Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) is used as the typeface. The site is deployed on [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
