I developed this submarine mine game as a major assignment for the Arduino UNO R3.

The implementation was done in C, where I constructed a custom engine without relying on the Arduino library.

This project served as my introduction to low-level embedded systems programming, from which I learned a lot. You can check out the source code via [this repository](https://github.com/niceduckdev/mine-game).
