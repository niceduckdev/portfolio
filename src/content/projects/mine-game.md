This project was made for the Embedded Programming course in my first year at KdG.

I developed a submarine mine game in C for the Arduino UNO R3. This was my first try at writing low level code on an embedded system and I learned a lot from it. I spent a lot of time thinking about the structure of my basic "framework" for the game.
