My second big assignment at KdG was to create a game for the Arduino UNO R3 using C without the arduino library. I ended up creating my own "engine" around some basic libraries written during class.

I developed a submarine mine game. This was my first try at writing low level code on an embedded system and I learned a lot from it.
