I got this assignment for the "User Interfaces 3" course. The goal was to create a frontend application to manage smart devices in your home.

We were orignally supposed to use a mock backend like `json-server` but we also got the option to choose a real one, I decided to use Pocketbase.

This was my first real project in React. I learned a lot about tackling such a large project, even though I had a lot of experience using Vue and Astro.
