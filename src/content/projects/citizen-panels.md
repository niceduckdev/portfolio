This application was made in team using [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)), [ASP.NET Core MVC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-9.0) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

We got the assignment to create an application that made it easier for organisations and citizens to organise and join [citizen panels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_Reference_Panel).

In total I spent around 250 hours developing this application. I was in charge of the user interface and user experience.
