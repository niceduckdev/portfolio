This application was made in team using C#, ASP.NET and PostgreSQL.

We got the assignment to create an application that made it easier for organisations and citizens to organise and join [citizen panels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_Reference_Panel).

My primary contribution was to the user experience. I designed and implemented the interface for the entire application over the course of 250 development hours.
