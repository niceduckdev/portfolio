We got the assignment to create an application that made it easier for organisations and citizens to organise and join [citizen panels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_Reference_Panel).

This application was made in team using the following stack.

| Type | Technology |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Backend | ASP.NET |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| SSR Frontend | Razor Views |
| CSR Frontend | Vanilla TS using Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |

My primary contribution was to the user experience. I designed and implemented the interface for the entire application over the course of 250 development hours.
