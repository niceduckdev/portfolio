I developed a full-featured Uno clone in Java with JavaFX, following the MVP architecture.

My initiative led to a custom system for managing the Models, Views and Presenters more efficiently across the application.

The project was later expanded to include online multiplayer, powered by the Kryonet networking library. You can check out the source code via [this repository](https://github.com/niceduckdev/four-colors).
